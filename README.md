## Introduction

This repository aims to provide structured prompt frameworks for using ChatGPT more effectively.
These frameworks guide the creation of prompts to ensure the AI understands the context,
task, and desired outcome clearly.

## Prompt Frameworks

### R-T-F

- **Role**: Specify the role you want the AI to assume.
- **Task**: Define the task you want the AI to perform.
- **Format**: Indicate the format in which you want the output.
- **Example**:

```
Act as a software architect. 
Design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. 
Create a diagram outlining the services, data flow, and interactions between components.
```

### S-O-L-V-E

- **Situation**: Define the context or situation.
- **Objective**: Specify the goals.
- **Limitations**: Define any limitations or constraints.
- **Vision**: Outline the vision or goal.
- **Execution**: Plan the steps for execution.
- **Example**:

```
You are managing a project to redesign the architecture of a legacy system with tight deadlines and limited resources.
Deliver a new software architecture.
Limited resources and tight deadlines.
Create a modern, scalable architecture.
Propose a step-by-step execution plan to transition from the old system to the new architecture.
```

### T-A-G

- **Task**: Define the task at hand.
- **Action**: State the action needed.
- **Goal**: Clarify the goal to be achieved.
- **Example**:

```
Improve the performance of a monolithic application.
Conduct a performance analysis, identify bottlenecks and propose a plan to refactor the application into a microservices architecture.
Achieve better scalability and maintainability.
```


### D-R-E-A-M

- **Define**: Define the problem or context.
- **Research**: State the research needed.
- **Execute**: How to execute the plan.
- **Analyze**: How to analyze the results.
- **Measure**: Define how to measure the outcomes.
- **Example**:

```
Challenges in scaling a monolithic application.
Potential solutions such as microservices, serverless architecture, and containerization.
Implement a pilot project for one of these solutions.
Performance improvements.
Impact on scalability.
```

### B-A-B

- **Before**: Explain the current situation or problem.
- **Action**: State the desired outcome or action.
- **Bridge**: Ask to bridge the current state to the desired state.
- **Example**:

```
Current monolithic application struggles with scalability issues.
Migrate to a microservices architecture.
Develop a detailed migration plan including steps to ensure data integrity, minimize downtime, and achieve a smooth transition.
```

### P-A-C-T

- **Problem**: Define the problem.
- **Approach**: Describe the approach.
- **Compromise**: Write about potential compromises.
- **Test**: Define the test or measurement.
- **Example**:

```
High cost of maintaining a monolithic application.
Migrate to a cloud-native microservices architecture.
Initial migration costs and training requirements.
How to test the new architectureâ€™s effectiveness.
```

### C-A-R-E

- **Context**: Give the context.
- **Action**: Describe the action needed.
- **Result**: Clarify the expected result.
- **Example**: Provide an example for clarity.
- **Example**:

```
Launching a new feature that requires a highly available and scalable architecture.
Design a microservices architecture to support this feature.
Architecture can handle a sudden increase in user traffic.
Provide an example of how this architecture can handle a sudden increase in user traffic
```

### F-O-C-U-S

- **Frame**: Define the frame or context.
- **Outline**: State the outline of steps.
- **Conduct**: How to conduct the plan.
- **Understand**: How to understand or analyze feedback.
- **Summarize**: Summarize the findings.
- **Example**:

```
Requirements for a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture for a financial application.
Steps to design this architecture.
Design process.
Feedback from stakeholders.
Final architecture design and its benefits.
```

### R-I-S-E

- **Role**: Specify the role.
- **Input**: Describe the input needed.
- **Steps**: Could you ask for steps to follow?
- **Expectation**: Describe the expectation.
- **Example**:

```
Software architect.
Requirements for a new microservices-based application.
Develop a detailed architecture plan.
Ensure the system is scalable and maintainable.
```

### M-I-N-D-S

- **Map**: Define the map or context.
- **Investigate**: What to investigate.
- **Navigate**: How to navigate through challenges.
- **Develop**: How to develop a plan.
- **Sustain**: Plan for sustaining efforts.
- **Example**:

```
Current architecture of a legacy application.
Potential challenges in migrating to a microservices architecture.
